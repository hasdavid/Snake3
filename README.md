# Snake³

Snake³ ("Snake Cubed") is a remake of the classic game Snake, where the player
traverses the surface of a cube, instead of a bounded 2D arena. This forces the
player to take into account the third dimension, increasing the game's
difficulty.

## How to Play

Download a precompiled executable for Windows from
[Releases](https://github.com/hasdavid/Snake3/releases) here on GitHub.
No installation necessary.

Or open this project in Unity to compile it yourself.

## Controls

- Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` or the arrow keys for movement.
- Press `Esc` to open the menu.

## Credits

The game was written based on a screenshot I saw somewhere. The implementation
is mine, but the idea belongs to the original author.
